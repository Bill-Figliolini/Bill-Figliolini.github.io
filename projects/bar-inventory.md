Name of the Project is a work in progress.

This app was inspired by a common gripe I have with other recipe tracking apps, both on the internet and on mobile. While they perform admirably at determining whether or not a recipe can be completed with what stock you have on hand, they do not consider quantity. This leads to situations where apps say a recipe is valid with current inventory, when in reality it is not on account of taking more ingredients than are actually on hand.

Bar-Inventory is an attempt to rectify this gap, to satisfy my own gripes. It will likely be more complicated than competitors, as one will need to commit each drink made so that the database can be updated.

It is still in prototyping phases while I learn how the UI library I am using works.
